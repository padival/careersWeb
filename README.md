### Tech stack used and reason

I have choosen React to build this application.

Reason:
1) React will have faster client side rendering of data.
2) It has some libraries which will help in rendering of JSON data like axios, underscore which i have used to fetch and filter the data as per my requirements.
3) React is developer friendly when compared to Angular and it is easy to understand if the developer know the basics of JS.
4) React helped me to build components for different layers, which helps in resuabilty or making code changes easier in the future.

### Other tech considered

Angular, if it was server side rendering i would have choosen NODE, Express and EJS (MVC format) or typical HTML, CSS, JS

### What would i do if i had more time

1) I would have added responsiveness for medium size display
2) On drop down change i would add filter to jobs displayed

### Better Experience
1) Add some design for dropdown and make it look more creative
2) Add footer to the page
3) Add search bar for search
